## ItoE (Knowledge Graph Embeddings using Neural It ÀÜùëú Process: From Multiple Walks to Stochastic Trajectories)

## Installation:
Install anaconda and required environment
(https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)

Run the following command to set the environment
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate the conda environment
```commandline
conda activate code_env
```
Set the environment variables
```commandline
source set_env.sh
```
## Datasets
Download and pre-process the datasets:
```commandline
source datasets/download.sh
python datasets/process.py
```
## Models
The framework includes:
* TransE
* DistMult
* RotatE
* ComplEx
* RotE
* RotH
* ATTE
* ATTH
* REFE
* REFH
* ItoE (Our model - Euclidean) - Currently under the name SDE in the script
* ItoP (Our model - Poincare) - Currently under the name SDP in the script
## Training
Run the example commands from the example commands folder
```bash
./train_SDP_WN18RR_32.sh
```
NB: One needs to make coomands executable before ruunning
```bash
chmod +x train_SDP_WN18RR_32.sh
```
Alternatively, one can run following example command (it is the optimal command for WN18RR for reproducing the results for this dataset, the best results mentioned in the paper was obtained based on early stopping criteria):
```commandline
python  run.py \
            --dataset WN18RR \
            --model SDP \
            --rank 32 \
            --regularizer N3 \
            --reg 0.0 \
            --optimizer Adam \
            --max_epochs 400 \
            --patience 20 \
            --valid 5 \
            --batch_size 100 \
            --neg_sample_size 500 \
            --init_size 0.001 \
            --learning_rate 0.001 \
            --gamma 0.0 \
            --bias learn \
            --dtype single \
            --double_neg \
            --multi_c \
            --cuda_n 0
```
